# Competitive Programming Algorithms In Kotlin

This repository contains my implementations of useful algorithms for competitive programming in the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language.
While the aim is for the algorithms to be as correct as possible, there might be a few mistakes.
Therefore, none of these is algorithms is meant to be deployed in production. However, since accuracy is important,
I'll try to write unit tests for each algorithm implemented.

## Resources used
Below are some resources I used to learn about the different algorithms in this repo:
- [Competitive programmers handbook](https://cses.fi/book.pdf)
- [Algorithms text book by Robert Sedgewick](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
- [CP algorithms site](https://cp-algorithms.com)
- Various blog posts on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com)
